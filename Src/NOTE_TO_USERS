I do not foresee anyone actually using this code, so I have not spent much time tidying it.
Apologies if my foresight is lacking.


An overview of the contents:
./Analysis
    >>> These three files contain most of the code for figures in the paper
    main_figs.py
    si_figs.py
    eq_vs_ji.py

    >>> The rest of the files are those used to analyse the data

./Distinguishability
    >>> This folder includes the model and code for Fig 3 in the SI

./MonteCarlo
    >>> Two files contain the main Monte Carlo model.
    >>> The differences between them are the functional forms of the biases
    model_ver_4.py
    model_ver_5.py

    >>> After running the model, a post-processing step was used to 
    >>> get all the appropriate data together
    post_processing.py

    >>> The others either contain functions, or were used to test something
