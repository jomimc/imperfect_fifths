# imperfect_fifths
Code for Monte Carlo simulations, analysis and figures for the paper:
"Cross-cultural data suggests musical scales evolved to maximise imperfect fifths", John M. McBride & Tsvi Tlusty (2019),
https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06171.

This package contains all the results and code needed to produce all of the
figures in the paper. See "Src/Analysis/main_figs.py" and "Src/Analysis/si_figs.py".
The main results of the Monte Carlo simulations are in "Results".

A list of necessary python packages are given in "requirements.txt".

The Monte Carlo simulation code is available in "Src/MonteCarlo".


A tidied version of the scales database is available in "database_format4sharing.csv".
